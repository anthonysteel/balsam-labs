\section*{Robot}
Why does a cooking robot not exist? Robots are not able to perform
dexterous manipulation. Why are robots incapable of dexterous manipulation?
One of the reasons is that robots lack a sense of touch or somatosensory
system. Let us consider perception of pressure and vibration first.
In humans there are a number of cells that are responsible
for the sense of touch:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Merkel cell
\item Tactile corpuscles
\item Pacinian corpuscles
\item Bulbous corpuscles
\end{enumerate}
Though a robot may not require this many sensory receptors,
it does make sense to investigate two: high fidelity and low fidelity.
